# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

This project was influenced by my desire to learn how to create a webpage and begin to understand the very comprehensive world of the languages a computer uses. 
I built this particular site as both a starting point of my understanding and reference for knowledge i have gained, and wish to retain.
I ( and possibly many others) will refer to this as a quick cheat sheet for all my computing needs, and will continue to build on it as my knowledge grows.
I learned that in order to not only succeed in a web development world, i need more patience than ever in order to not overthink various attributes of the computers language and will eventually understand that i will EVENTUALLY get it. I might be dumb now, but that is because i just havent learned how to aquire or use the knowledge to be needed to be gained YET.
